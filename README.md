# Toussaint_lab_barcodes
Recovery of barcodes from UCE capture sequences


!! update script to do plate by plate rather than all in one
!! update python script to produce just CBX number and software (e.g., CBX0123_GO); the BOLD database doesn't like the fasta header format we used

### If you used the scripts on github, please ensure you check the directory structure.
